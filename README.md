##Esra Assistant - The Open Source Personal Assistant

ESRA => Experimental Speech Response Application

Esra Assistant is a personal assistant currently under heavy development (and very beta), developed for iOS 5+ and compatible with all latest variations of the iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

It has been open sourced in order to welcome further contributions towards the project, which is currently available on Cydia for free.

This version of Esra Assistant, however, is the heavily revamped and entirely rewritten version of the current release (v. 1.1-1), and is nowhere near done.

##To-Do List

- Rewrite "snippet views" in a way that plugins are easily developed.
- Write a decent plugin API
- Redesign User Interface
- Completely get rid of IB?

##Known Issues

- The loader does not disappear from the view after it's finished loading
- The loader is out of place on 5" screens
- Esra can only listen to you once, it no longer listens after listening once (related to   	issue #1?)
- Microphone button sounds (listen/stop listen) do not play
